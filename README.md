## Hey, I’m Issac 👋

I’m a Full Stack Software Engineer.

I've led and contributed to projects spanning front-end, back-end, and DevOps. My expertise lies in building and optimizing web applications using modern frameworks like React + Next.js, TypeScript, Express.js and Flask/Python, while leveraging AWS cloud infrastructure for scalable deployments.

### 🧠 What I focus on
- 🧱 **Full-Stack Engineering** – Experienced in building and maintaining scalable systems across the front and back end, with clean, well-structured code and a strong grasp of infrastructure.
- ⚙️ **DevOps & Automation** – Comfortable setting up CI/CD with GitHub Actions and deploying on AWS with a focus on repeatability and security.
- 💻 **Modern Web Development** – Skilled in React, Next.js, TypeScript, PayloadCMS, Flask, and Express. I enjoy building thoughtful, user-centric applications.
- 🤖 **AI-Enhanced Workflows** – Exploring how tools like Cursor and OpenAI can boost productivity, automate workflows, and support better developer experience.


### 🌱 Currently Exploring/Learning
- Rapid prototyping with modern BaaS platforms like PayloadCMS, Convex, and Supabase — aiming to ship faster without sacrificing flexibility.
